# anExpenses Tracker App

## Description

anExpenses is a simple yet effective web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to effortlessly track their income and expenses. Users can add new transactions, categorize them (e.g., Salary, Groceries, Rent), specify the amount, and input the date. The app dynamically updates and displays the user's current balance, total income, and total expenses, providing a clear overview of their financial status. Additionally, users can edit or delete existing transactions as needed. 

## Features

**HTML:**

-   **Structured Layout:** The HTML code provides a clear and organized structure for the application, including sections for displaying the balance, income, expenses, transaction history, and a form for adding new transactions.
-   **Semantic Elements:** The use of semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<table>` and others enhances the code's readability and accessibility.
-   **Form Handling:** A form is implemented using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<button>` elements to facilitate user input for adding new transactions.

**CSS:**

-   **Visually Appealing Design:** The CSS code is responsible for the application's clean and modern look, enhancing its visual appeal.
-   **Responsive Layout:**  The layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across multiple devices.
-   **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** The use of different font sizes, weights, and colors effectively establishes a visual hierarchy, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the information presented.

**JavaScript:**

-   **Dynamic Updates:** JavaScript enables dynamic updates to the application's content, such as adding new transactions, updating the balance, income, and expenses in real-time without requiring page reloads.
-   **Local Storage:** The app leverages local storage to persist transaction data, ensuring that the user's data is saved and available even after closing or refreshing the browser window.
-   **User Interaction:** JavaScript handles user interactions, including adding new transactions, editing existing ones, and deleting transactions.
-   **Form Validation:** The application includes basic form validation to ensure that users provide all necessary information before submitting a new transaction.

2.  **Add Transactions:** Users can input details for new transactions, including the category, amount (positive for income, negative for expenses), and date. The app then dynamically updates the transaction history, balance, income, and expenses based on this new data.
3.  **Categorize Transactions:**  Users can select from a predefined list of categories to organize their transactions, making it easier to analyze spending patterns.
